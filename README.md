# End-to-End Bank Customer Churn Prediction using ANN and Streamlit

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in the banking sector using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, providing an interactive web application for real-time predictions. By identifying customers likely to churn, banks can implement targeted retention strategies to enhance customer loyalty and reduce revenue loss.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Application**: Built with Streamlit, allowing users to input customer data and receive immediate churn predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive handling of missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling to prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Utilization of TensorFlow and Keras to develop and train the ANN model.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessment of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- **Deployment**: Deployment of the model as a web application for easy access and use.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For building and training the ANN model.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web interface.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and performance evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
